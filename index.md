## AI for Earth Sciences

Earth sciences or geosciences encompasses understanding the physical characteristics of our planet, including its lithosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere and biosphere, applying all fields of natural and computational sciences. As Earth sciences enters the era of increasing volumes and variety of geo-scientific data from sensors, as well as high performance computing simulations, machine learning methods are poised to augment and in some cases replace traditional methods. Interest in the application of machine learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning, computer vision and robotics to the geosciences is growing rapidly at major Earth science and machine learning conferences.

Our workshop seeks to bring cutting edge geoscientific and planetary challenges to the fore for the machine learning and deep learning communities. We seek machine learning interest from major areas encompassed by Earth sciences which include, atmospheric physics, hydrologic sciences, cryosphere science, oceanography, geology, planetary sciences, space weather, geo-health (i.e. water, land and air pollution), volcanism, seismology and biogeosciences. 

## Schedule

ICLR will be a [fully virtual conference](https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2020/virtual). Details about how to tune into our livestream on April 26 are forthcoming. We've divided our workshop into several themed sections: [Atmospheric Science](#    atmospheric-science), [Hydro and Cryospheres](#hydro-and-cryospheres), [Solid Earth](#solid-earth), [Theoretical Advances](#theoretical-advances), [Remote Sensing](#remote-sensing), [EnviroNet](#environet), [Keynotes](#keynotes). 

All times are listed in Pacific Daylight Time (US, California).  More details about the talks may be found [here](./talks.html)
