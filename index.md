Our workshop brings together earth scientists and machine learning experts to try to solve some of the earth's greatest problems.  We've divided our workshop into several themed sections: [Atmospheric Science](#atmospheric-science), [Hydro and Cryospheres](#hydro-and-cryospheres), [Solid Earth](#solid-earth), [Theoretical Advances](#theoretical-advances), [Remote Sensing](#remote-sensing), [EnviroNet](#environet), [Keynotes](#keynotes). 

## Schedule

Tune into our [livestream](https://slideslive.com/38926826/ai-for-earth-sciences) on April 26 from 7am-4pm PDT (San Francisco) time to see the talks. Join us in [slack](https://join.slack.com/t/ai4earth/shared_invite/zt-e30wpddc-lVNgNthtO_HYQOmR0Id~yQ) to mingle with workshop attendees. 

The duration shown in the schedule is approximate time allocated for introduction, video recording, and Q&A for each topic.

*Zoom attendees must completely close the ICLR stream before speaking in the zoom conference (seriously - you will regret it if you don't)*

All times are listed in Pacific Daylight Time (San Francisco, USA).
